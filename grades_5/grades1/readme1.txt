The first part of the program, we create a function called createArray
that creates a 2 dimensional array from the text file that 
is read using ifstream. 

The second function readFile is used to find the average of all
the exams and print them. 
We use static keyword to represent variables that should remain 
unchanged. 

All the functions are called inside the main function.
