Grades project is a c++ program that reads a text file and reads the content line 
by line to display the students' names, exam scores, number of exams, average exam scores and letter grade.
The algorithm then assigns variable names to the different
data in different tabs using the c++ symbol operator >>.
Since not all rows of data have the same amount of columns, this
causes a problem in c++ so we use if condition statemnet that
checks the number of subjects in each row and assigns each 
of them the correct variables. 
The program then sums up grades in each row and uses the if-else
condition statements once more to check the number of exams to calculate 
the average. 
We then use the if-else condition statements to assign each student a grade.
